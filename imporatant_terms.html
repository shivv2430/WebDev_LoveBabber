<li><b><i><u>Dynamic Websites(web application):</b></u></i> Websites that generate content on-the-fly based on user interactions or server-side processing. They often use server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby.</li>
<h2><u><i>More Important Terms:</i></u></h2>
<li><b>API (Application Programming Interface):</b> A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs are commonly used to connect frontend and backend systems.</li>

<h2><b><i><u>Network types </u></i></b></h2>
<ul><b>metropolitan network</b></ul>
<ul><b>local area network</b></ul>
<ul><b>wide area network</b></ul>
<ul><b>personal area network</b></ul>  
<l><i><b>Internet:</b></i>A global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows for the exchange of information and communication worldwide. It is the backbone of the World Wide Web (WWW) and enables access to websites, email, social media, and various online services.</li>
<li><i><b>WWW (World Wide Web):</b></i> A system of interlinked hypertext documents and resources accessed via the internet. It allows users to view and navigate web pages using web browsers.</li>
<li><i><b>URL (Uniform Resource Locator):</b></i> The address used to access a specific resource on the internet, such as a web page. It typically consists of the protocol (e.g., http or https), domain name, and path to the resource.</li>
<li><i><b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</b></i> The protocol used for transmitting hypertext (web pages) over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web servers and clients (browsers).</li>
<li><i><b>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</b></i> An extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security by encrypting data exchanged between the web server and client using SSL/TLS protocols. It ensures secure communication and protects sensitive information.</li>
<li><i><b>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):</b></i> A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other on the internet.</li>
<li><i><b>DNS (Domain Name System):</b></i> A hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It acts as a directory for the internet, allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.</li>
<li><i><b>Web Server:</b></i> A computer or software application that hosts websites and delivers web pages to users' browsers upon request. It processes incoming requests, retrieves the requested resources, and sends them back to the client.</li>
<li><i><b>Web Browser:</b></i> A software application used to access and view web pages on the internet. Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.</li>

<h2><b><i><u>Definitions of Important Terms:</u></i></b></h2>
Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows for the exchange of information and communication worldwide. It is the backbone of the World Wide Web (WWW) and enables access to websites, email, social media, and various online services.
 model is a distributed application architecture that separates the client (user interface) from the server (data storage and processing).In this model, the client sends requests to the server, which processes the requests and returns the appropriate responses.
<p1>WWW(World Wide Web) is a service on the internet that allows users to access and share information through web pages and websites.In www different documents and resources are connected by hyperlinks and URLs.    
www is a subset of internet.
IP address is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
DNS(Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.  
Browser is a software application used to access and view websites on the internet.Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. 
Browser engine is a software component of a web browser that interprets and renders web content, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to display web pages to users. Examples of browser engines include Blink (used by Google Chrome) and Gecko (used by Mozilla Firefox). Webkit (used by Safari).
